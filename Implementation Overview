<Brief Overview of Enterprise Structure - Oracle Fusion HCM>

Introduction to Enterprise Structure:

Core Concept: The enterprise structure, also known as the organization structure, is foundational in Oracle Fusion HCM implementations. It must be configured before other modules can be effectively set up.
Configuration Necessity: The initial step in implementing Oracle Fusion HCM is to engage with the client to understand their global presence, including the number of countries they operate in, legal entities, branches, departments, and locations.
Setting Up Enterprise Structure:

Task Access: The enterprise structure is configured using the task called "Establish Enterprise Structure."
Documentation: Oracle provides detailed documentation for setting up the enterprise structure, emphasizing its critical role in successful implementation.
Role of Consultants:

Responsibility: Typically, a senior-level functional consultant interacts directly with the client to gather requirements and configure the enterprise structure.
Client Interaction: Consultants must clearly understand Oracle's architectural framework to effectively communicate with clients and map their business hierarchy to Oracle's structure.
Detailed Configuration Process:

Enterprise Identification: The name of the company (e.g., "Xerox Corporation") is identified as the 'Enterprise'.
Legal and Head Office Information: Gathering comprehensive legal information and head office details is crucial.
Organizational Divisions and Legal Entities:

Divisions: Defined based on business needs to separate profit and loss by region or country; however, creating divisions is optional and currently offers limited features in Oracle.
Legal Entities: Defined based on where the company is legally registered, crucial for compliance and operational structuring.
Financial and Operational Structure:

Legislative Data Groups and Ledgers: Important for managing payroll structures and financial transactions, respectively.
Business Units: Reflect operational divisions within a legal entity, handling core business functions such as sales and procurement.
Reference Data Sets:

Purpose: Used to manage and reference data such as departments, job roles, and locations, crucial for organizational structuring within Oracle Fusion HCM.
Summary and Future Steps:

The understanding of enterprise structure setup is fundamental before diving into Oracleâ€™s comprehensive documentation. Practical, hands-on configuration will be covered in subsequent training sections, moving from theoretical understanding to practical application.
This summary encapsulates the key elements and steps for setting up an enterprise structure in Oracle Fusion HCM, as outlined in the provided transcript.
